# React Calculator

In this project, I used create-react-app to generate my application and then built off of its basic boilerplate. 

### Components:
1. Display - describes what I want to show on the browser (this also includes updating). 
2. Buttons - both numbers and operators 
3. Calculations - created a separate file just for the "equal" functionality (i.e. getting the result number)
