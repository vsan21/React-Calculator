# React Calculator

In this project, I used create-react-app to generate my application and then built off of its basic boilerplate. 

### Components:
1. Display - describes what I want to show on the browser (this also includes updating). 
2. Buttons - both numbers and operators 
3. Calculations - created a separate file just for the "equal" functionality (i.e. getting the result number)

#### If you would like to clone this project and run it on your own local machine, follow the steps: 
1. Copy the repo URL
2. In your terminal, run `git clone <URL>`
3. `cd React-Calculator`
4. `npm start` or `yarn start` (this will host the application on localhost:3000)
